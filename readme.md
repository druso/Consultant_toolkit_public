### 👋 Welcome to Consultant Toolkit: 

This project has been developed during my free time, heavily assisted by ChatGPT and Gemini.

It is a collection of python functions wrapped in a cozy Streamlit app!

The tool will ask for [Groq](https://groq.com/), [Openai](https://platform.openai.com/), [Oxylab](https://oxylabs.io/) and [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) API keys if not provided within the environment.

It can be used without setting the keys, but related service won't be available and errors may arise.
Finally the repository can be deployed easily using [Railway](https://railway.app/) or run locally as a streamlit app (streamlit run Hello.py)

With that said..

**🚧 This is a work in progress, and your feedback is super valuable! 🙏**

Navigate the tools using the sidebar on the left. Upload files and configure options (like your favorite LLM ).
Don't forget to take not of your  **session_id**! It's your key 🔑 to retrieving content and logs later on using the 💾 Session Recovery if needed. The tool runs on API keys with tiny budgets 💰, so use it wisely or help me find a 💸sponsor💸! 

⚠️ Important: Data is hosted on US servers 🇺🇸, and LLM requests share info with OpenAI or Groq. Be mindful of your data!

## 📈 Generative Excel

[🔗Jump there](/Generative_Excel)

This let's you load a csv or an excel and run bulk operations on it. Once you'll load a file you can navigate through the tabs to access different functions.

* **LLM**
 Here you can run bulk requests to a Large Language Model. You can select a column that will be used as the message to pass to the LLM and a system message with the instruction to do with that field. Like: 
    - assign the text to a category between the following 4...
    - summarize the text that is provided...
    - tell me if this needs my attention based on...

* **SerpAPI**
 Here you can run bulk requests to SerpAPI, at the moment only the retrieval of organic search results for a given query is present.
 But we can add more, there are a lot of information that can be retrieved [🔗check out the endless opportunities](https://serpapi.com/search-api) just ask, we can implement new requests quite easily.

* **Crawl**
 Here you can retrieve the content from a provided url. If you have urls in a column it will download in the dataframe the content of each website. Work can be done here, depending on how useful this is going to be

* **Amazon**
 Here you can retrieve product information or reviews from amazon, providing ASINs code. Much more can be added, feel free to take a look at oxylabs documentation. [🔗check out the endless opportunities](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/ecommerce) 


You can keep working on the file by switching to different tabs so you can cuncatenate different requests. For example you can requests organic search results from serpAPI, crawl the results with the crawler and finally run an LLM to summarize the contents of the websites.

**Pro Tip**: some requests return structured data (like serpAPI), you can unroll the structured data using the "Colum Expander" function below the Preview of the table. Select the column to unroll and it will do the magic.

## 📋 Doc Assistant

[Jump there](/Doc_Assistant)
Here you can process any text document (word, txt, pdf) in order to quickly extract relevant information. Multiple documents can be uploaded at once. You follow these steps:
* **Prepare the content**
 The file needs to be divided into smaller chunk. Default options should work for most needs, but you never know. If you want to tinker you can change the length of the chunk of text and the overlap between chunks. The longer the chunks the less precise the search activity will be.
* **Study the content**
 Each chunk will be processed through an embedding function and made ready to be searched for meanings
* **Question the content**
 Finally you can input your request, the tool will search and retrieve the content, you will be shown a response to the question and a box with the relevant content extracted for the response.
 You can further configure the behaviour of the tool with:
    * *context chunk*: the tool will stitch neighbour chunks to the most relevant one. If you created a memory of small chunks, I suggest you keep some context sorrounding the relevant bit so that it's easier for the tool to grasp the relevant information to provide you with an answer
    * *number of content*: you can have the tool return not just the one bit of content that is most relevant, but more bits of relevant content across the whole text


## 🎙️ Audio Transcriber

[Jump there](/Audio_Transcriber)
Here you can load an audio of speech, have it transcrived and summarized.
You can change the behaviour of the summarization by optimizing the summarization prompt

## 💾 Session Recovery

[Jump there](/Session_Recovery)
Here you can download logs from any session. Partially executed files and entire logs of any api call is available to dowload from here in case needed.
